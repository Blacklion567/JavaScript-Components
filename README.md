# Random-JS

- This is just a random learning of Javascript (JS) components to enhance my learning about Javascript, so I just read the code and understand it. It's better to understand the code than familiarize myself with it, so it's better to code while understanding the code.

<h1>JavaScript Components</h1>

# Map

- The map() method is used for creating a new array from an existing one, applying a function to each one of the elements of the first array.

```js
Syntax
var new_array = arr.map(function callback(element, index, array) {
    // Return value for new_array
}[, thisArg])

```

## In the callback, only the array element is required. Usually some action is performed on the value and then a new value is returned

Example
In the following example, each number in an array is doubled.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const doubled = numbers.map(item => item * 2);
console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

### Filter

- The filter() method takes each element in an array and it applies a conditional statement against it. If this conditional returns true, the element gets pushed to the output array. If the condition returns false, the element does not get pushed to the output array.

```js
Syntax
var new_array = arr.filter(function callback(element, index, array) {
    // Return true or false
}[, thisArg])
```

- The syntax for filter is similar to map, except the callback function should return true to keep the element, or false otherwise. In the callback, only the element is required.

### Examples

- In the following example, odd numbers are "filtered" out, leaving only even numbers.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const evens = numbers.filter(item => item % 2 === 0);
console.log(evens); // [2, 4]
In the next example, filter() is used to get all the students whose grades are greater than or equal to 90.

const students = [
  { name: 'Quincy', grade: 96 },
  { name: 'Jason', grade: 84 },
  { name: 'Alexis', grade: 100 },
  { name: 'Sam', grade: 65 },
  { name: 'Katie', grade: 90 }
];

const studentGrades = students.filter(student => student.grade >= 90);
return studentGrades; // [ { name: 'Quincy', grade: 96 }, { name: 'Alexis', grade: 100 }, { name: 'Katie', grade: 90 } ]
```

### Reduce

- The reduce() method reduces an array of values down to just one value. To get the output value, it runs a reducer function on each element of the array.

```js
// Syntax
arr.reduce(callback[, initialValue])
```

- The callback argument is a function that will be called once for every item in the array. This function takes four arguments, but often only the first two are used.

- accumulator - the returned value of the previous iteration
- currentValue - the current item in the array
- index - the index of the current item
- array - the original array on which reduce was called
- The initialValue argument is optional. If provided, it will be used as the initial accumulator value in the first call to the callback function.

### Examples

- The following example adds every number together in an array of numbers.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const sum = numbers.reduce(function (result, item) {
  return result + item;
}, 0);
console.log(sum); // 10
```

- In the next example, reduce() is used to transform an array of strings into a single object that shows how many times each string appears in the array. Notice this call to reduce passes an empty object {} as the initialValue parameter. This will be used as the initial value of the accumulator (the first argument) passed to the callback function.

```js
var pets = ['dog', 'chicken', 'cat', 'dog', 'chicken', 'chicken', 'rabbit'];

var petCounts = pets.reduce(function(obj, pet){
    if (!obj[pet]) {
        obj[pet] = 1;
    } else {
        obj[pet]++;
    }
    return obj;
}, {});

console.log(petCounts);

/*
Output:
 {
    dog: 2,
    chicken: 3,
    cat: 1,
    rabbit: 1
 }
 */
```

# How to Use filter()

- filter() is a method that lets you create a new array based on conditions that evaluate to true from an existing array.
Take a look at the example below:

```js
let animals = [
   {name: 'Tibbers', type: 'cat', isNeutered: true, age: 2},
   {name: 'Fluffball', type: 'rabbit', isNeutered: false, age: 1},
   {name: 'Strawhat', type: 'cat', isNeutered: true, age: 5}
 ]

 /*using imperative*/
 let neuteredAnimals = [];

for (let i=0; i < animals.length; i++){
  let a = animals[i];
  if(a.isNeutered){
    neuteredAnimals.push(a);
  }
}
```

- The above example is a procedural pattern we often see in the wild as a way to loop through each item in the array, test the condition then push it into the new array.

With the filter() method, you just need to set the condition. For example:

```js
let animals = [
    {name: 'Tibbers', type: 'cat', isNeutered: true, age: 2},
    {name: 'Fluffball', type: 'rabbit', isNeutered: false, age: 1},
    {name: 'Strawhat', type: 'cat', isNeutered: true, age: 5}
  ]

 /*using functional filter() where a represents an item in the array*/
 let neuteredAnimals = animals.filter((a) => {
     return a.isNeutered;
 });
```

- Here, we just need to set up the filter method against the array. The anonymous function lets a represent a single item in the array in the same manner as a = animals[i] did in the procedural pattern. Whatever is returned within the filter() is what gets put into the new array.

How to use find()
In JavaScript, find() is used to create a new object based on the condition you set. On the surface, it looks like filter() but theyâ€™re not the same. filter() returns an array of matched objects while find() will return the first matched object.

See the example below:

```js
let animals = [
    {name: 'Tibbers', type: 'cat', isNeutered: true, age: 2},
    {name: 'Fluffball', type: 'rabbit', isNeutered: false, age: 1},
    {name: 'Strawhat', type: 'cat', isNeutered: true, age: 5}
  ]


animalTypeFound = animals.find( animal => animal.type === 'cat' );

// animalTypeFound will return:
// {name: 'Tibbers', type: 'cat', isNeutered: true, age: 2}

animalTypeFilter = animals.filter( animal => animal.type === 'cat' );

// animalTypeFilter will return:
// [{name: 'Tibbers', type: 'cat', isNeutered: true, age: 2}, {name: 'Strawhat', type: 'cat', isNeutered: true, age: 5}]
```
=> find()will stop at the first match while filter() will continue and return all matched items in the array.


## How to Use map()

- You have an array but you want it to look different. You could loop through using a forEach() function but that will only create complications later down the line.

- Mapping lets you move the values around, reassign them to different selectors and whatever else you want to do to them. The result of map() is an object that lets you store key-pair values or just an array of simple values.

- See the code below for syntax and examples:

```js
let animals = [
    {name: 'Tibbers', type: 'cat', isNeutered: true, age: 2},
    {name: 'Fluffball', type: 'rabbit', isNeutered: false, age: 1},
    {name: 'Strawhat', type: 'cat', isNeutered: true, age: 5}
  ]

// what you need:
// ['Tibbers', 'Fluffball', 'Strawhat']

let animalNames = animals.map(animal => {return animal.name});

// what you need:
// [{name: 'Tibbers', species: 'cat'}, {name: 'Fluffball', species: 'rabbit'}, {name: 'Strawhat', species: 'cat'}]

let petDetails = animals.map(animal => {
    return {
        name: animal.name,
        species: animal.type
    };
});
```

### How to Use reduce()

- We hear about reduce from time to time but no one really talks about what exactly it is. In short, reduce lets you interact two values or objects adjacent to each other from left to right.

- For example, you have the following array: [100, 20, 10]

- If you were to use reduce() on it, the first set of values will be 100 and 20. Then whatever the output of that is used to interact with 10.

```js
let numbers = [100, 20, 10];
// result will return 70 as the value
// The function inside reduce will run twice.
// the first time, x = 100, y = 20
// the second time, x = 80, y = 10
```

- result = numbers.reduce((x, y) => { return x - y; });
reduce() can also take two arguments. The first is the function that determines what happens to the two values and the second sets the starting value.

```js
let animals = [
    {name: 'Tibbers', type: 'cat', isNeutered: true, age: 2},
    {name: 'Fluffball', type: 'rabbit', isNeutered: false, age: 1},
    {name: 'Strawhat', type: 'cat', isNeutered: true, age: 5}
  ]

// How old are all the animals combined?
// 0 is the starting value and acts as the first acculmulator value
// will return 8

let totalAge = animals.reduce((acculmulator, animal) => {
    return acculmulator + animal.age;
}, 0);

// lets say you want to find out the oldest animal
// code below will return {name: 'Strawhat', type: 'cat', isNeutered: true, age: 5}

let oldestPet = animals.reduce((oldest, animal) => {
    return (oldest.age || 0) > animal.age ? oldest : animal;
  }, {});

  // decrypting the code above and how terniaries work
  // the condition --> (oldest.age || 0) > animal.age
  // if true --> ? oldest
  // else --> : animal
```


# How to Use every()
Every returns a true or false value based on the condition set. It works in a similar fashion as filter() but instead of returning an object or value, every() spits back a boolean.

This makes it good for quickly checking whether everything inside an array meets the criteria.

```js
let animals = [
    {name: 'Tibbers', type: 'cat', isNeutered: true, age: 2},
    {name: 'Fluffball', type: 'rabbit', isNeutered: false, age: 1},
    {name: 'Strawhat', type: 'cat', isNeutered: true, age: 5}
  ]

let allNeutered = animals.every(animal => {return animal.isNeutered});
//will return false because not all values under isNeutered evaluates to true
```

# How to use some()
some() works the same way as every() but only at least one of the conditions needs to evaluate to true.

See example below:

```js
let animals = [
    {name: 'Tibbers', type: 'cat', isNeutered: true, age: 2},
    {name: 'Fluffball', type: 'rabbit', isNeutered: false, age: 1},
    {name: 'Strawhat', type: 'cat', isNeutered: true, age: 5}
  ]

let someAreCats = animals.some(animal => {return animal.type === 'cat'});

// will return true because at least one animal.type returned 'cat'
```
## In real-world use cases, you might use every() and some() to check values in an array before sending them off to the database.

Or perhaps you want to make sure that there is a certain category of an item in a cart before applying a special discount. Or youâ€™re coding a booking system and you wanted to make sure that every customer who can book satisfies the minimum age requirements.

## Lets Mix and Match!
You can use these array methods on their own or in chains. The result from the first method will be used as the value for the following method.

See the example below:

```js
let animals = [
    {name: 'Tibbers', type: 'cat', isNeutered: true, age: 2, enteredPagent: true, cutenessScore: 347},
    {name: 'Fluffball', type: 'rabbit', isNeutered: false, age: 1, enteredPagent: true, cutenessScore: 193},
    {name: 'Strawhat', type: 'cat', isNeutered: true, age: 5, enteredPagent: false, cutenessScore: 521}
  ]

//lets say you want to find the total cuteness score of all valid pagent entrants

let totalScore = animals
                    .filter(animal => {return animal.isNeutered})
                    .reduce((accumulator, animal) => {return accumulator + animal.cutenessScore}, 0);

// totalScore will return 868
```

Depending on your dataset, you can become quite efficient with arrays, reducing the need to manually loop through every object and array to do what you need to do.

Final Words
For all the examples in one place, Iâ€™ve created a GitHub repo for your reference.

JavaScript can be efficient â€” if you take the time to learn it properly. Developers new to JavaScript tend to fall into procedural patterns because itâ€™s easy.

However, easy can quickly turn into a spaghetti jumble of complicated once you work with more than one for or while loop. Array methods eliminate the potential craziness that comes with long code, nested brackets and, lost semi-colons.
